            "If you would convince a man that he does wrong, do right. But do not care to convince him. Men will believe what they see. Let them see.",
            "I cannot trust a man to control others who cannot control himself.",
            "Consensus: the process of abandoning all beliefs, principles, values, and policies in search of something in which no one believes, but to which no one objects; the process of avoiding the very issues that have to be solved, merely because you cannot get agreement on the way ahead. What great cause would have been fought and won under the banner: ‘I stand for consensus?",

            "In the end, it is important to remember that we cannot become what we need to be by remaining what we are.",
            "A leader isn’t someone who forces others to make him stronger; a leader is someone willing to give his strength to others so that they may have the strength to stand on their own.",
            "Always remember, Son, the best boss is the one who bosses the least. Whether it’s cattle, or horses, or men, the least government is the best government.",
            "If you really want the key to success, start by doing the opposite of what everyone else is doing.",
            "Give as few orders as possible,” his father had told him once long ago. “Once you’ve given orders on a subject, you must always give orders on that subject.",
            "The art of leadership is saying no, not yes. It is very easy to say yes.",
            "Wisdom equals knowledge plus courage. You have to not only know what to do and when to do it, but you have to also be brave enough to follow through.",
            "In a battle between two ideas, the best one doesn’t necessarily win. No, the idea that wins is the one with the most fearless heretic behind it.",
            "If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.",
            "Remember, teamwork begins by building trust. And the only way to do that is to overcome our need for invulnerability.",
            "Leadership is an action, not a position.",
            "Surround yourself with great people; delegate authority; get out of the way.",
            "I cannot give you a formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure, which is: Try to please everybody.",

            "Whenever you see a successful business, someone once made a courageous decision.",

            "People buy into the leader before they buy into the vision.",
            "A good leader is a person who takes a little more than his share of the blame and a little less than his share of the credit.",
            "A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week.",
            "Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it.",

            "You wouldn’t worry so much about what others think of you if you realized how seldom they do.",
            "Low self-confidence isn’t a life sentence. Self-confidence can be learned, practiced, and mastered-just like any other skill. Once you master it, everything in your life will change for the better.",
            "Shyness has a strange element of narcissism, a belief that how we look, how we perform, is truly important to other people.",
            "Do it or not. There is no try.",
            "Rarely have I seen a situation where doing less than the other guy is a good strategy.",
            "You may have to fight a battle more than once to win it.",
            "The best revenge is massive success.",
